# AGENTS.md — MD/Sidepad

Guidance for any agent (Claude Code, etc.) working in this repo. `CLAUDE.md` just imports this file.

See also: `programming.md` (full shared-region table and budget rules), `README.md` (high-level region/userfw overview), and the sibling apps `md-drives-emulator`, `md-snap`, `md-devops`, `md-js` in the same parent folder — they are proven references for the cartridge/handoff patterns and were leaned on heavily while debugging.

## What this repo is

Template-derived **Sidecartridge Multi-device microfirmware app** targeting Atari ST / STE / MegaST(E). Each "app" is a UF2 image that runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) plugged into the Multi-device cartridge slot, emulating a ROM cartridge for the Atari while also handling networking, SD card I/O, and config. Public build/usage docs: <https://docs.sidecartridge.com/sidecartridge-multidevice/programming/>.

**MD/Sidepad** pairs a Bluetooth gamepad with the Atari ST and injects it as **joystick 1** (optionally right-stick-as-mouse). The BLE host is Bluepad32 on the Pico W's CYW43 chip; WiFi is stripped because it shares that chip. UUID `7795c766-c5a8-4607-bc7d-01c55e03d300`; **`pico_w`-only** (CYW43 required for BLE).

## Environment setup

- **ARM GNU Toolchain** — export `PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` to its `arm-none-eabi/bin` dir. The project historically pins **14.2**; the current dev box uses **15.2** (`/Applications/ArmGNUToolchain/15.2.rel1/arm-none-eabi/bin`) and it builds and runs cleanly. Both work — the last toolchain-sensitive serving bug was removed by the inline hook-publish fix (see the ETV serving lesson below). If you see `arm-none-eabi-gcc not found`, this var is wrong.
- **`atarist-toolkit-docker`** (`stcmd`) — needed for the m68k target. `stcmd` requires a PTY (`pty=true`). `target/atarist/build.sh` exports `STCMD_NO_TTY=1` for every stcmd call it makes; export it yourself only if invoking `stcmd` directly from a non-TTY context (CI, sub-shells).
- **Raspberry Pi Debug Probe / Picoprobe** for the serial console — TX, RX, and **both** GND pins must be connected. The debug UART is the main "verification" channel; the one host test is `make -C rp/test test`.
- **SDK paths** — auto-set from the repo if unset; to set explicitly:
  ```bash
  export PICO_SDK_PATH=$REPO_ROOT/pico-sdk
  export PICO_EXTRAS_PATH=$REPO_ROOT/pico-extras
  export FATFS_SDK_PATH=$REPO_ROOT/fatfs-sdk
  ```
- Optional debugger helpers: `export ARM_GDB_PATH=…/arm-none-eabi/bin`, `export PICO_OPENOCD_PATH=…/openocd/tcl`.

## Build

Top-level build is driven by `build.sh` in the repo root:

```bash
# <board_type> = pico | pico_w | sidecartos_16mb   (MD/Sidepad is pico_w only)
# <build_type> = debug | release   (note: always compiled as MinSizeRel — see below)
# <app_uuid_key> = UUID4 identifying this app, must match desc/app.json
./build.sh pico_w release 7795c766-c5a8-4607-bc7d-01c55e03d300
```

Build flow (orchestrated by `build.sh`):
1. Increments the patch version (`tools/bump_version.sh`) and copies `version.txt` into `rp/` and `target/atarist/`.
2. Builds the Atari ST target (`target/atarist/build.sh`) via `stcmd make`. Enforces an **8 KB hard limit** on `BOOT.BIN` (`CHANDLER_CARTRIDGE_CODE_SIZE` in `rp/src/include/chandler.h`, mirrored as `CARTRIDGE_CODE_SIZE` in `target/atarist/src/main.s`); over-budget aborts with `ERROR: cartridge code is N bytes; limit is 8192`. A separate copy (`FIRMWARE.IMG`) is padded to 64 KB to fill the shared region, and `firmware.py` converts it into `rp/src/include/target_firmware.h` (a C byte array embedded in the RP firmware).
3. Builds the RP firmware (`rp/build.sh`): pins submodule versions (pico-sdk 2.2.0, pico-extras sdk-2.2.0, fatfs-sdk at a specific commit), runs CMake, produces `rp/dist/rp-<board>.uf2`. FatFs config lives at `rp/src/ff/ffconf.h` and shadows the submodule's default via `target_include_directories(... BEFORE PRIVATE)` in `rp/src/CMakeLists.txt`, so the `fatfs-sdk` submodule stays pristine.
4. Computes MD5, renames to `dist/<APP_UUID>-<VERSION>.uf2`, and substitutes UUID/MD5/version into `dist/<APP_UUID>.json` from the `desc/app.json` template.

Successful builds drop UF2s into `dist/` and print the MD5 used in the generated JSON manifest. Verification = `make -C rp/test test` passes (the Xpad block writer's host test, also run by CI), the build succeeds, the UF2 boots on hardware, and behaviour is confirmed over the serial console.

### Build gotchas
- **CMake always builds with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`** regardless of `<build_type>`. A full `Release` previously caused breakage (memory/over-optimization); the legacy line is left commented in `rp/build.sh`. `<build_type>` only controls the `DEBUG_MODE` macro and the dist filename.
- **`DEBUG_MODE` → `_DEBUG` in CMake:** `debug` builds keep `DPRINTF` (UART on); `release` compiles them out (silent). This was **broken** for a long time: `rp/src/CMakeLists.txt` had `if (NOT _DEBUG) set(_DEBUG 1)`, and CMake treats the string `"0"` as false, so `release` (DEBUG_MODE=0) was forced back to `_DEBUG=1` — **every** build shipped full UART logging. Fixed to `if (NOT DEFINED _DEBUG OR "${_DEBUG}" STREQUAL "")`. If a release build is ever chatty on UART again, look here first.
- **`firmware.py` odd-length trap:** it trims trailing zeros from the 64 KB image, then aborts with `ValueError` if the result is an **odd** number of bytes. `target/atarist/build.sh` now checks its exit code and fails hard (`exit 6`); before that, a failed run left the previous `rp/src/include/target_firmware.h` in place and the RP build silently embedded a **stale** cartridge → ST boots straight to desktop, no terminal. If you append `dc.b` data to the m68k image and hit this, pad `userfw.s` so the trimmed size stays even (a trailing `dc.w $FFFF` outside the copied block works — see the ETV `userfw.s`).
- `CHARACTER_GAP_MS` must remain defined (700) in `rp/src/include/blink.h` — removing it breaks the RP build.
- Harmless VASM warnings during the m68k build (`target data type overflow`, `trailing garbage after option -D`) can be ignored.
- `stcmd` without a PTY fails with `the input device is not a TTY`; without `STCMD_NO_TTY=1` the m68k build can fail **silently**, the previous `BOOT.BIN` survives, and the RP firmware serves a stale cartridge → garbage on the ST while commands still work. Confirm `target/atarist/dist/BOOT.BIN` was regenerated by the current build (compare timestamps in `dist/`).

### CI / release
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds `pico_w` Release on PR.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `v*` tags: builds, attaches UF2 + JSON to the GitHub Release, uploads to `s3://atarist.sidecartridge.com/`.
- `make tag` tags HEAD with the contents of `version.txt` and pushes the tag (which triggers release).
- `upload_s3.sh <file>` is a manual one-off uploader; needs `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

## Architecture

Two-target build: m68k assembly runs on the Atari ST, is compiled into a ROM image, embedded as a C array inside the RP2040 firmware, and served back to the Atari over the cartridge bus that the RP2040 emulates via PIO + DMA.

### Atari ST side (`target/atarist/`)
- `src/main.s` — m68k cartridge boot + dispatch + terminal. Lives at `$FA0000` (ROM4 cartridge region). Defines the cartridge header (`CA_MAGIC`, `CA_INIT`, …), command magic numbers, and the shared-variable layout.
- `src/userfw.s` — **the primary extension point for app-specific m68k code.** `src/userfw.ld` places `main.s` at offset `0x0000` (2 KB budget) and `userfw.s` at `0x0800` (6 KB budget); `main.s` exposes the latter as `USERFW equ (ROM4_ADDR + $800)`. When the RP raises `CMD_START = 4` on the cartridge sentinel, the m68k's vsync-polled `check_commands` dispatches to `rom_function`, which `jmp`s to `USERFW`.
- Adding more m68k modules: add a `.text_<name>` section in `userfw.ld`, mirror the offset with an `equ (ROM4_ADDR + $????)` in `main.s`, and add the `.o` target to `target/atarist/Makefile` (like `gemdrive.ld` in `md-drives-emulator`).
- The cartridge image (header + all `.text_*` sections) must fit in 8 KB; a 64 KB padded copy becomes `target_firmware.h`.

### Shared 64 KB cartridge region
The Atari sees a 64 KB window `$FA0000`–`$FAFFFF`, mirrored RP-side at **`0x20030000`** (the `ROM_IN_RAM` base). **Single source of truth** for cross-target layout — both sides derive every offset symbolically from `rp/src/include/chandler.h` (RP) and `target/atarist/src/main.s` (m68k). **Never hard-code an address inside this region.**

| Offset | Symbol | Size | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$FA0000` | cartridge image | 8 KB | m68k header + all `.text_*` sections (hard limit) |
| `$FA2000` | `CMD_MAGIC_SENTINEL` | 4 B | m68k polls here for NOP/RESET/BOOT_GEM/START/TERMINAL words |
| `$FA2010` | 60 × 4 B indexed shared variables (`SHARED_VARIABLES`) | 240 B | after `RANDOM_TOKEN`/`SEED`/reserved at `$FA2004`–`$FA200F` |
| `$FA2100` | `APP_BUFFERS` / `APP_FREE` | ~48 KB | app arena (first 512 B are the high-res mask table) |
| `$FAE0C0` | `FRAMEBUFFER` | 8000 B | 320×200 mono; at the top so an overrun walks off the 64 KB end |

See `programming.md` for the full table and budget rules.

### RP2040 side (`rp/src/`)
- `main.c` — sets clock/voltage, single-sample SELECT-at-boot → Booster hatch, `gconfig_init` (global) then `aconfig_init` (per-app), hands off to `emul_start()`. Config-init failure jumps to Booster via `reset_jump_to_booster()`. **Don't add features to `main.c`** — put them in `emul.c`. (Early-boot recovery hatches like the SELECT check are the deliberate exception; keep them single-sample, no loops/delays.)
- `emul.c` / `emul.h` — the app's main loop and entry point; add features here.
- `romemul.c` / `romemul.pio` — PIO + chained-DMA runtime that serves the cartridge ROM bus autonomously (no CPU/IRQ). The serving base is `&__rom_in_ram_start__ >> 16` pushed to the PIO once; `__rom_in_ram_start__` **must** be 64 KB-aligned (it is, at `0x20030000`).
- `commemul.c` — ROM3 command-receive channel (m68k→RP). Needs `commemul_init()` once at startup (in `emul_start()` after `chandler_init()`). No `Keystroke:` logs → check this first. commemul + romemul share **pio0**; commemul's ring is `__attribute__((aligned(COMM_RING_SIZE_BYTES)))`.
- `gconfig.c` / `aconfig.c` — global vs per-app config in dedicated flash sectors, on top of `settings/`.
- `network.c`, `httpc/`, `download.c` — Wi-Fi/BLE (CYW43, lwIP poll mode), HTTP client, firmware download.
- `sdcard.c`, `hw_config.c` — FatFs over SPI/SDIO.
- `display.c`, `display_term.c`, `term.c`, `u8g2/` — terminal rendered into the Atari framebuffer and/or a local OLED.
- `blink.c`, `select.c`, `reset.c`, `tprotocol.c`, `chandler.c` — LED Morse status, SELECT button, soft reset/jump-to-booster, transport primitives, command handler + shared-var access.

### Memory layout (`rp/src/memmap_rp.ld`)
The RP2040's 2 MB flash and 264 KB SRAM are sliced into named regions; code must not stomp on them.

| Region | Origin | Length | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FLASH` | `0x10000000` | 1024 K | App code |
| `ROM_TEMP` | `0x10100000` | 128 K | Scratch for loaded ROMs |
| `BOOSTER_APP_FLASH` | `0x10120000` | 768 K | Reserved for Booster (do not write) |
| `CONFIG_FLASH` | `0x101E0000` | 120 K | 30 sectors of per-app config |
| `GLOBAL_LOOKUP_FLASH` | `0x101FE000` | 4 K | UUID → config-sector lookup |
| `GLOBAL_CONFIG_FLASH` | `0x101FF000` | 4 K | Global config |
| `RAM` | `0x20000000` | **192 K** | .data/.bss/heap (reclaims the old upper 64 KB) |
| `ROM_IN_RAM` | **`0x20030000`** | **64 K** | cartridge mirror served to the Atari (**not** `0x20020000` — older docs were wrong) |
| `SCRATCH_X` / `SCRATCH_Y` | `0x20040000` / `0x20041000` | 4 K each | core1 / core0 stacks |

Core 0 owns flash writes (`PICO_FLASH_ASSUME_CORE0_SAFE=1`) and overclocks to 225 MHz at `VREG_VOLTAGE_1_10`. **Caveat:** `__StackLimit` (the heap ceiling) is computed as `ORIGIN(RAM)+LENGTH(RAM)+LENGTH(ROM_IN_RAM)` = `0x20040000`, i.e. the heap is *allowed* to grow through the cartridge mirror. Same as md-snap; md-devops caps it at `ORIGIN(RAM)+LENGTH(RAM)`. It was investigated and ruled out as the cause of the ETV debug-serving bug, but it's a latent fragility if heap use ever gets heavy.

### App identity
`CURRENT_APP_UUID_KEY` (from `APP_UUID_KEY` at CMake time) must match `uuid` in `desc/app.json` and keys into `GLOBAL_LOOKUP_FLASH` to find this app's config sector. Mismatch → jump to Booster.

## Xpad

`xpad` is a **submodule** at the repository root, not a vendored copy:
`rp/src/xpadstate.c` writes that ABI and must not drift from what
consumers are compiled against. Do not edit anything under `xpad/`;
change it upstream in atarist-xpad and bump.

    git submodule update --remote xpad

Two things it is worth knowing before changing anything here.

`xpadstate.c` carries `_Static_assert`s tying its own offsets to the
header, so a bump that moves a field fails the build rather than
producing a block nobody agrees with. Keep them.

`target/atarist/src/userfw.s` includes xpad's generated `xpad.inc`
directly. That works because `target/atarist/build.sh` mounts the
repository root (`stcmd` mounts exactly one directory) and runs make in
the subdirectory, with `-I../../xpad/src` in the Makefile; build.sh
refuses with a clear message if the submodule is missing. The one Xpad
number still spelled out by hand is `XPAD_BLOCK equ $FA2300`, the
block's home in the cartridge window, which is this product's choice
rather than xpad's and is pinned on the RP side by a `_Static_assert`
against `CHANDLER_APP_FREE_OFFSET`.

## MD/Sidepad specifics

The pieces below are hard-won and non-obvious — read before touching the command path, joystick injection, or the booster/desktop exits.

### Keymap (single-key, `sidepadInputCb`)
`ESC` = exit to GEM desktop (installs the joystick hook on the way out), `P` = pair, `M` = toggle right-stick-as-mouse, `J` = toggle joystick injection (Xpad is published either way), **`H` = toggle VBL (`$70`) / ETV (`$400`) hook mode**, `B` = exit to Booster (full chip reset). The dedicated ST **Help** key toggles a help screen; it carries no useful ASCII, so `sidepadInputCb` dispatches it from the scan code (`SCAN_HELP = 0x62`) in bits 16–23 of the keystroke payload (`TERM_KEYBOARD_SCAN_MASK`). The template terminal is **line-based** (`term_command_cb` buffers until Enter), so MD/Sidepad registers its **own** `chandler_addCB(sidepadInputCb)` to act on the first keypress. `APP_TERMINAL_START` = ESC, `APP_TERMINAL_KEYSTROKE` = any other key. `H`/`M`/`J` persist via per-app config (`ACONFIG_PARAM_HOOK` / `ACONFIG_PARAM_MOUSE` / `ACONFIG_PARAM_JOYSTICK`; joystick defaults on when the key is absent), saved in `exitToGemDesktop`.

### Joystick injection (`target/atarist/src/userfw.s`)
- Hook the **VBL autovector `$70`**, *not* a `_vblqueue` slot — GEM reclaims free `_vblqueue` slots when the desktop loads, silently de-linking the hook. `$70` is the OS VBL entry; GEM only adds/removes `_vblqueue` entries (which the `$70` handler walks), so a hook there survives into the desktop. Chain to the saved original.
- **VBL vs ETV (selectable, implemented and hardware-verified):** two resident entry points share one `do_inject` routine and the same `push orig_hook; rts` chain (valid for the `$70` autovector — orig rte's the interrupt frame — **and** the `$400` etv_timer subroutine — orig rts's back to TOS' MFP ISR which rte's; confirmed against `md-devops` runner.s). The installer reads the hook-mode flag from shared-var **slot 6** (`HOOK_FLAG_ADDR = $FA202B`) and hooks `$70` or `resident_etv_start` at `$400`. etv_timer fires ~200 Hz, so the ETV entry rate-limits (`ETV_DIVISOR = 4` → ~50 Hz) to match VBL. **Default = ETV** (`ACONFIG_PARAM_HOOK` default `"true"`); `[H]` switches to VBL. ETV survives programs that replace the VBL vector, so it's the more compatible default (esp. games).
- The cartridge region is emulated **read-only**: fetches/reads work, **stores bus-error**. The resident handler keeps writable state (prev sample, packet buffer, saved joyvec, orig hook, `etv_div`) in RAM — the installer `Malloc`s a block (`GEMDOS_Malloc` 72) and copies a position-independent handler in. Reads of the shared region still work, so it reads the controller byte in place.
- Read **joyvec live each frame** from KBDVECS (`XBIOS Kbdvbase` 34, joyvec at **offset 24** — not 20). A reader typically installs its own joyvec *after* us; a snapshot would bypass it. Same live-read for mousevec (offset 16).
- Synthesise a TOS joystick packet `[$FF, joy0, joy1]` with the `$FF` header at an **odd** address (consumers read `move.w 1(a0)`). Our state → **joy1**. IKBD encoding: bit0=Up, bit1=Down, bit2=Left, bit3=Right, **bit7=Fire**. The RP packs fire into bit6; userfw moves it to bit7.

### RP→m68k handoff (`emul.c` exit path + `main.s`)
- **Inject only on exit-to-desktop, never during the terminal loop.** Installing the hook while the terminal is live races the VBL handler's cartridge-bus reads against the terminal's `send_sync` protocol and corrupts keystroke delivery.
- Exit sequence (`exitToGemDesktop`): publish the hook-mode flag (slot 6) **inline** first, then send `DISPLAY_COMMAND_START` (`CMD_START`=4) for several frames so the m68k installs the hook (idempotent), then `DISPLAY_COMMAND_CONTINUE` (`CMD_BOOT_GEM`=2) for several frames, then loop forever pumping `controller_poll` + `writeBtJoyState`. **Burst both commands** — a single sentinel write can race the m68k's vsync-paced `check_commands` and be dropped (symptom: firmware-load message flashes, then the terminal returns).
- `main.s` `check_commands`: `CMD_START` does `bne .no_start / bsr rom_function / bra bypass`. `rom_function` runs the installer **once** via a **PC-relative** `userfw_installed` guard — an absolute sentinel write here would bus-error. `boot_gem` is just `rts`; the cartridge runs as `CA_INIT` (header bit 27), the stack is balanced through `pre_auto`→relocation→print-loop, so `rts` returns to TOS and continues to the desktop. `main.s` also has an early CA_INIT `cmp #CMD_BOOT_GEM; beq boot_gem` so a warm ST reset (RP keeps the sentinel latched) goes straight to the desktop with the pad. `emul_start` **zeroes the sentinel before `init_romemul`** so a stale `CMD_BOOT_GEM` in SRAM can't make the first boot skip the terminal (`chandler_init` zeroes only the reserved slot, not the sentinel).

### Shared-variable byte order
`firmware.py` packs little-endian words and the cartridge bus per-word swap cancels at the word-**value** level, so `SET_SHARED_VAR(idx, V)` makes the m68k `move.l SHARED_VARIABLES+idx*4` read back `V`. Slots used: **3** = joystick byte (LSB at `$FA201F`), **4** = connected flag (`$FA2023`), **5** = mouse packet (`$FA2024`), **6** = VBL/ETV hook flag (`$FA202B`). A direct inline store must match SET_SHARED_VAR's layout: low word at `slot+2`, high word at `slot+0`.

### "No terminal on boot" — disambiguate three distinct causes (healthy UART each)
1. **Desktop loads but broken/corrupt** (cursor jumps, unusable) → **mouse-flood**: `writeBtMouseState` must gate on `st.connected` (has regressed twice).
2. **Clean desktop, no terminal, cartridge appears absent** → **served too late**: TOS scans `$FA0000` very early; anything delaying `emul_start` before `init_romemul` (or heavy blocking pre-serve UART on debug builds) pushes serving past the scan window. Keep `main.c` and pre-`init_romemul` `emul_start` lean; the per-entry `aconfig` lookup dump and the `gconfig`/`aconfig` `settings_print(NULL)` dumps were removed for this reason. The CMake `_DEBUG` bug above made *every* build pay this UART cost.
3. **Clean desktop, no terminal, RAM mirror byte-perfect** → the **serving-path layout bug**: see below.

### The ETV serving lesson (function vs inline)
Publishing the hook-mode flag via a `static void writeHookMode()` **helper function** deterministically broke ROM serving on **debug** builds (ST boots to a clean GEM desktop, no terminal) while release builds were fine. Proven — over ~15 hardware images + UART probes — **not** to be timing (a build with *less* pre-serve logging still failed), heap growth (capping the heap didn't help), mirror corruption (probes: header + sentinel stay byte-perfect through the app loop), the sentinel, or the toolchain (**14.2 and 15.2 fail identically**). Root cause never fully explained — a binary-layout sensitivity on the autonomous PIO/DMA serving path. **The fix that works everywhere: publish the flag inline (direct `volatile uint16_t` stores) instead of via a single-use function.** If a tiny addition to `emul.c` ever breaks serving in a debug build again, suspect this class and prefer inlining over a new helper. (Full write-up in the agent's memory: `sidepad-debug-serving-gotchas`.)

### Other gotchas
- Bluepad32's CMake defaults to `pico_cyw43_arch_none`; `rp/src/CMakeLists.txt` patches it at configure time to `pico_cyw43_arch_lwip_poll` so it coexists with lwIP without modifying the submodule.
- Once a controller connects, the terminal counts down `SIDEPAD_AUTOEXIT_SECONDS` (10) then exits to the desktop as if ESC was pressed (any key/controller input cancels, stickily).

### Known limitation (by design)
Injection rides the IKBD `joyvec` path. Games/demos that read the joystick straight from the IKBD ACIA interrupt (e.g. the Blood Money demo) bypass `joyvec` entirely and **will not see the pad**; tools that go through `joyvec` (PP's JOYMOUT, most games — Duke Nukem works in ETV mode) do. Separately, joystick-1 fire is physically wired to the **right mouse button** at the IKBD, so synthesised fire also shows as a right-click — expected ST hardware behaviour.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix / cause |
| --- | --- |
| `the input device is not a TTY` from `stcmd` | Run from a PTY, or `export STCMD_NO_TTY=1` before invoking `stcmd` directly. |
| `arm-none-eabi-gcc not found` | `PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` is wrong — point it at the toolchain `bin` dir. |
| Missing `CHARACTER_GAP_MS` build error | Re-add `#define CHARACTER_GAP_MS 700` to `rp/src/include/blink.h`. |
| `ERROR: cartridge code is N bytes; limit is 8192` | m68k cartridge > 8 KB. Trim `main.s`/includes or move data into APP_BUFFERS / SHARED_VARIABLES instead of the cartridge image. |
| `firmware.py` fails / build exits 6 | Trimmed cartridge image is odd-length. Pad `userfw.s` (trailing `dc.w $FFFF` outside the copied block) so it stays even. |
| Final steps fail copying UF2 | Upstream compile failed — scroll back to the first error. |
| ST shows garbage but commands work | `target_firmware.h` is stale — `stcmd make` likely failed silently. Confirm `target/atarist/dist/BOOT.BIN` timestamp matches the rest of `dist/`. |
| Release build is noisy on UART | The CMake `if(NOT _DEBUG)` silent-release bug — see Build gotchas. |
| Clean desktop, no terminal | Three causes — see "No terminal on boot" above (mouse-flood / served-too-late / serving-path layout). |
| `No Keystroke:` logs | `commemul_init()` not called at startup. |

## Editing guardrails

- **Never modify** `pico-sdk/`, `pico-extras/`, or `fatfs-sdk/` — pinned submodules, re-pinned every build. Change FatFs config via `rp/src/ff/ffconf.h` (project-owned override; the include path makes it win).
- Don't touch `main.c` for feature work — start in `emul.c`. (Early-boot recovery hatches are the only exception; keep them single-sample.)
- Match the existing C style (`.clang-format`, `.clang-tidy`, wired via CMake when the binaries are on `PATH`).
- Keep the pre-`init_romemul` path lean; don't add blocking work (busy-waits, heavy UART) ahead of serving.

## Working style

Bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

1. **Think before coding** — state assumptions; if multiple interpretations exist, present them; if a simpler approach exists, say so; if something's unclear, stop and ask.
2. **Simplicity first** — minimum code that solves the problem, nothing speculative. No abstractions for single-use code (the ETV bug is a live reminder: a single-use helper broke serving where an inline store did not). No unrequested flexibility, no error handling for impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.
3. **Surgical changes** — touch only what you must; don't "improve" adjacent code/formatting; match existing style; mention unrelated dead code rather than deleting it; remove only what your change orphans. Every changed line should trace to the request.
4. **Goal-driven execution** — define success criteria and loop until verified. "Verified" here means: `make -C rp/test test` passes, the build succeeds, it boots on hardware, and the behaviour is confirmed over the serial console. State a brief plan with a verification check per step for multi-step work.
5. **No AI attribution** — never add AI-tool attribution to commits, PRs, code comments, docs, or any artifact. No `Co-Authored-By: Claude …`, no "Generated with Claude Code / ChatGPT", no "AI-assisted" notes. Write everything as the human author.

Keep this file current as the process evolves so every agent starts with the latest tribal knowledge.
