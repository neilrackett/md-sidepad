; Sidepad user firmware: inject the BT controller as Atari ST joystick 1, and
; (when mouse mode is on) the right stick as the GEM mouse via the IKBD mousevec.
;
; Called once (via main.s rom_function) when the RP raises CMD_START.
;
; Mechanism
; ---------
; The RP writes a packed controller state byte to shared-variable slot 3
; every loop (bit0=Up, bit1=Down, bit2=Left, bit3=Right, bit6=Fire - the standard
; IKBD encoding, confirmed on hardware via JOYMOUT). A handler hooked onto the VBL autovector
; ($70) watches that byte and, when it changes, synthesises a TOS joystick packet
; [$FF, joy0, joy1] (our state in the joy1 byte) and calls the system joyvec. The
; real joyvec is left in place, so a physical joystick on port 1 keeps working
; alongside the controller — whichever one is moved drives joystick 1.
;
; Why hook $70 and not _vblqueue
; ------------------------------
; A free _vblqueue slot works during boot but GEM reclaims it for its own VBL
; routines when the desktop loads, silently de-linking us. The $70 autovector is
; the OS's VBL entry point and GEM does not replace it (it only adds/removes
; _vblqueue entries, which the $70 handler walks), so a hook there survives into
; the desktop. We chain to the saved original so the OS VBL processing still runs.
;
; VBL vs ETV hook (selectable at install time)
; --------------------------------------------
; The RP publishes a hook-mode flag to shared-var slot 6 (HOOK_FLAG_ADDR) before
; the installer runs: 0 = VBL, 1 = ETV. VBL ($70) fires every vsync (~50 Hz) and
; is the default. ETV (etv_timer, $400) is a TOS subroutine vector called from the
; MFP Timer C interrupt at ~200 Hz; it survives programs that replace the VBL
; vector, but we only need ~50 Hz so the ETV entry injects on every ETV_DIVISOR'th
; tick (4 -> ~50 Hz) and chains the rest. Both entries share one injection routine
; and the same `push orig; rts` chain, valid for the $70 autovector (the saved
; original rte's the interrupt frame) and the $400 subroutine (the saved original
; rts's back to TOS' MFP ISR, which rte's).
;
; Why copy to RAM
; ---------------
; The whole cartridge region ($FA0000-$FAFFFF) is emulated read-only to the
; ST: code can be fetched/read from it, but stores bus-error. The resident
; handler needs writable state (saved joyvec, previous sample, packet
; buffer), so the installer Malloc's a RAM block and copies the resident,
; position-independent handler into it. Reads of the shared region (the
; controller byte) still work, so the handler reads slot 3 in place.
